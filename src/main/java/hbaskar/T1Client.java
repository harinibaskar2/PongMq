/**
 * This class represents the client side of a simple Pong-style game that 
 * communicates with a server using MQTT messaging protocol. It manages the 
 * lifecycle of both a publisher and a subscriber to send and receive game 
 * state updates asynchronously.
 * 
 * The client publishes its paddle position to the server and subscribes to 
 * receive updates such as the ball position and the serverâ€™s paddle position.
 * 
 * It runs the publisher and subscriber on separate threads to allow 
 * simultaneous sending and receiving of MQTT messages, ensuring smooth 
 * gameplay interaction.
 * 
 * The class also provides a method to cleanly stop both the publisher and 
 * subscriber threads, facilitating proper resource cleanup.
 * 
 * This class acts as a coordinator for MQTT communication on the client side,
 * while the actual publishing and subscribing logic is encapsulated in the 
 * T1Publisher and T1Subscriber classes.
