/**
 * This class represents the server side of a simple Pong-style game that 
 * manages MQTT communication with one or more clients. It controls the 
 * game state publishing and listens for client updates via MQTT messaging.
 * 
 * The server publishes the ballâ€™s position and its own paddle position to 
 * subscribed clients, while subscribing to receive paddle position updates 
 * from clients.
 * 
 * It runs both a publisher and a subscriber on separate threads to enable 
 * asynchronous bidirectional communication, allowing real-time game state 
 * synchronization.
 * 
 * The class provides a method to stop the publisher and subscriber threads 
 * cleanly, ensuring proper disconnection and resource management.
 * 
 * This class serves as the main coordinator of MQTT message handling on the 
 * server side, delegating the actual message sending and receiving to the 
 * T1Publisher and T1Subscriber classes.
